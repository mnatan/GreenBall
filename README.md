GreenBall
=========

The game I created during my studies on Jagiellonian University to develop my C++ skills. It turned out to be grapical 3D game. For the time being i use pure OpenGL and SDL to create my own game engine.

I did not think about pushing the repo to GitHub at the beginning, so the major part of the project is commented in my native language - Polish.

Installation
=========
The project is under very big logic redesign in order to separate game engine from the game itself. If you want to compile and run it, you are going to have to look for some working commits in the branch history.
