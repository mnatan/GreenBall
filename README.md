GreenBall
=========

The game I created during my studies at the Jagiellonian University to develop my C++ skills. It turned out to be a graphical 3D game. For the time being I'm using pure OpenGL and SDL to create my own game engine.

I did not think about pushing the repo to GitHub at the beginning, so a major part of the project is commented in my native language - Polish.

Installation
=========
The project is under a very big logic redesign in order to separate the game engine from the game itself. If you want to compile and run it, you are going to have to look for some working commits in the branch history.
