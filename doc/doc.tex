\chapter{Introduction}
The <<Green Ball>> Game Engine is written in C++ with use of OpenGL rendering API. I started it to pursue my dream about using my spatial imagination for programming and developing video games. It turned out to be very absorbing and I started separating game engine from the game itself, to make adding new features easier. With this project I learned a lot about abstract programming, development and design patterns.
